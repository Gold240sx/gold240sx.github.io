Hey, Thanks for your time in overviewing my skill test submission and for the opportunity to challenge myself and work on this project!

## To run the project 🏃

### Option 1: locally 🧑‍💻

1. Right-Click on the src/index.html file in your favorite editor. Select "Open with Live Server" or "Open with Five Server" to view the project. (The live server extension is available in Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace). The project will then open in your default browser.

### Option 2: Pre-Hosted 🌐

I've also hosted this project on GitHub Pages. You can view the project by clicking on the link below:

## function check 🧐

( Feel free to also check my work locally by specifying a hardcoded array in compute.js. the format for the array should be:

```
	const encodedMessage = [3, 6, 2, 4, 1, 5, 47, 29, 73, 49] ).
```

I've left my hardcoded array in the compute.js file for your convenience. 😁
